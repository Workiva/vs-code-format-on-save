# OverReact Format On Save

This is a VS code extension meant to enable OverReact Format to run when a file is saved. 

## Setting up the extension

<!-- TODO -->

## Enabling Line Length Detection
 
OverReact Format has the capability to pull a line length from the standard `dev.dart` tool used to configure Workiva's DartDev tool. If you have a library that is using DartDev, this plugin can also be configured to pull the line length from `dev.dart`.

To enable the capability:
1. Go to VS Code's settings ("`cmd + ,`" by default).
1. Direct to the Extension settings, using the navigation menu on the left of the settings window
1. In the dropdown for "Extensions", find "OverReact Format..." and click on it
1. Check the box for "Format on Save: Detect Custom Line Length"

**Enjoy!**
